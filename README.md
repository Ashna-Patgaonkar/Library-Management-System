# Library Database Management System (Java Swing + MySQL)

This project is a **Library Management System** built using **Java Swing** for the user interface and **MySQL** as the database. It simplifies the management of library operations like adding, searching, and issuing books, providing a user-friendly interface and efficient database connectivity through **JDBC**.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Add new books to the library database with details like title, author, and book ID.
- **Search Books**: Search for books by title, author, or book ID.
- **Issue Books**: Issue books to users and track the issued status.
- **Seamless Database Integration**: Automated data retrieval and manipulation with JDBC, eliminating manual database access.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Java Swing to offer a simple and intuitive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Java (Swing)**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **MySQL**: For storing and managing the libraryâ€™s book data.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: For connecting Java applications to MySQL and performing database operations.

## System Requirements

- **Java**: Version 8 or higher
- **MySQL**: Version 5.7 or higher
- **IDE**: Any Java-compatible IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans
